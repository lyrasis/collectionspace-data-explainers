Info on data functionality and tradeoffs in CollectionSpace for migration clients

After conducting a number of migrations from other systems into CollectionSpace, we find ourselves explaining the same details repeatedly in order to assist our clients in making data decisions and reviewing their data. 

This is a place to collect those explanations so that we do not have to write them out from scratch each time.

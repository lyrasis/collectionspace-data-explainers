= Object location, Location/movement/inventory (LMI) procedure, and Storage location authority

== Key points

* Location information for an object is not recorded directly in the Object record.
* The Location/movement/inventory (LMI) procedure records information about the _procedure_ or _process_ of identifying/assigning the location of an object or objects, moving an object or objects, and/or conducting an inventory of an object or objects.
* Relationships must be created between the LMI procedure and the object(s) whose location or movement it describes
* If an object is related to one or more LMI procedures, the currentLocation field value from the most recent related LMI procedure is displayed in the object record as `Computed current location`. You can also search for objects by their `Computed current location` value.

== Examples
=== Single object, single LMI

*The _Computed current location_ field in _IN2020.56_ is _Storage room C_*

== LMI location fields

These fields are populated with values from either of the Storage Location authorities (local or offsite), or the local Organization authority.

In the Public Art domain profile (and Fine and Contemporary Art (FCART) starting with CS 7.2) you can also use terms from the local Place authority in these fields.

In the Botanical Garden domain profile, only terms from local Storage Location and local Organization authorities can be used.

NOTE: The sections below are titled using the underlying data field name, which is consistent across all domain profiles.

=== currentLocation

In general:

* This field is labeled: "Current location"
* This is a **required** field in the LMI procedure

Exceptions:

* Local history & material culture (LHMC) profile
** Labeled: "Temp location/building"
* Botanical garden profile
** Labeled: "Garden location"
** **Not a required field when manually entering records**

=== normalLocation

In general:

* This field is labeled: "Normal location"
* This is not a required field in the LMI procedure

Exceptions:

* Local history & material culture (LHMC) profile
** Labeled: "Home location/building"
* Botanical garden profile
** Not included in record

If there is only one related LMI, that LMI's _Current location_ becomes the object's _Computed current location_.

_Computed current location_ = _Storage room C_

LOC2023.6.02 has no location date but was updated more recently than LOC2023.6.01.

LMIs with _Location date_ values win over those that don't.

None of the LMIs has a location date.

The order of last record update, oldest to most recent is:

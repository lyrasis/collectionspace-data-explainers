= Review and correct structured date parsing

toc::[]

This page covers how to export data from CollectionSpace (CS) to review structured date parsing.

[TIP]
====
Structured date fields pop up this mini-form when you edit them:

image::structured_date_ui.png[1340]
+++&nbsp;+++

Starting with CollectionSpace 7.1, there is a CSV listing all structured date fields in all record types in all profiles in https://github.com/collectionspace/cspace-config-untangler/tree/main/data/reference[the `data/reference` directory], in the directory for the xref:cs_version_and_profile_info.adoc[release version].
====

Date data is notoriously inconsistent, ambiguous, and messy.

Every application has to make some assumptions and decisions about how to handle dates. These assumptions may or may not match up with user expectations of how dates should be handled. CollectionSpace (CS) is no different.

The best reference for understanding how CS derives the detailed date fields for a structured date field value (like Object Production Date) is https://github.com/collectionspace/services/blob/master/services/structureddate/structureddate/src/test/resources/test-dates.yaml[the application's date processing test data].

Even if you are manually entering data into CS, it is easy to miss the fact that dates have been parsed in unexpected ways, so doing some periodic review is not a bad idea.

[CAUTION]
====
If you are importing structured dates via the CSV Importer, or Lyrasis Migration Specialists have migrated your date data, the date processing can be a bit different than what you get when entering a date manually in the application.

The reason for this is that calling the CollectionSpace application date processor for each date value in a large batch would be extremely slow, so we try to handle as many date formats as possible with fast code that runs in the batch processing code itself.

It is recommended batch imported/migrated date data be reviewed to ensure dates have not been parsed in unexpected ways.

The processing reports produced by the CSV Importer and our migration ingest tooling include warnings on all structured dates that could not be parsed into date details.
====

== Dates that are not parsed

The details in the date mini-form could not be populated for a given date value, which may impact searching or sorting on date values.

The fix for these is to either:

* manually populate the date details in the mini-form; OR
* enter the date in a format that the application can parse

=== Strategies for identifying
==== Use CSV Importer reports
If any of your dates were unparseable, you will see the message: "One or more records has warning: unparseable_structured_date" when the Processing step is complete.

+++&nbsp;+++

Both the processing report and the full report generated after record transfer indicate exactly which structured date values could not be parsed. Limit to rows where the `WARN: unparseable_structured_date` column is not empty.

==== In migrations

The migration tooling we use generates the same warnings and similar reports as the CSV Importer.

If a large number of dates are unparsable due to a pattern we can correct in the migration, we try to do that.

Otherwise your Migration Specialist will typically add these reports to Post-migration cleanup task list in your migration Basecamp project for you to handle after the migration is complete.

==== Query in application - specific field

Here we search for all Object production dates where there is a display date value, but date details were not computed:

+++&nbsp;+++

==== Query in application - batch imported dates only

This query will find unparseable dates in any field, but only if the date data was loaded:

* via batch import (CSV Importer or migration process); AND
* after mid-October 2022

+++&nbsp;+++

Reviewing these may be more time-consuming, as you do not have any indication which structured date field(s) in the object records are affected.

== Unexpected date parsing

Here, the details in the date mini-form are populated, but may not have been populated as expected.

Example: if you enter Acquisition date "11/28/22", the year will be parsed as the year 22 C.E., and your searches for acquisitions from 2022 will not include this record.

This issue is trickier to identify. Having general familiarity with your data and expected/reasonable date values for your collections will help.

=== Targeted search checks
This is where your specific data knowledge will be invaluable.

If you know that the oldest object in your collection is from 1782, you might check:

image::structured_date_unparsed_query_yr_less_than.png[1634]
+++&nbsp;+++

You could do the same search, but on Acquisition records and the Acquisition date field if you know when your earliest acquisitions were.

=== Date data export and review

Currently the application does not support exporting the values of the date details fields from the user interface.

If you have read/query access to your CS database, see https://github.com/lyrasis/collectionspace-sql/blob/main/reports/structured_date_field_data.adoc[collectionspace-sql queries for reporting structured date data] for example queries.

If you do not have read/query access to to your CS database, and you are Lyrasis-hosted, you can request a date data report via Zendesk. Let us know what fields (in what records) you want reports for.

= CollectionSpace data explainers

This documentation focuses in depth on how data behaves and can be used in CollectionSpace.

The primary audience for this documentation is folks at institutions migrating into CollectionSpace, who need to make informed decisions about how to migrate data into CS.  

Information is added to this site in response to actual client questions in the process of LYRASIS custom migrations into CS.

IMPORTANT: Since this documentation is being developed and primarily used in the context of custom migrations into LYRASIS-hosted CollectionSpace instances, some information here may be specific to LYRASIS' architecture and instance configuration setup.
